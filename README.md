## About The Project
This project is a **train simulation** system that allows users to create and manage a **train network**. Users can define key components of the network, including:

- **Stations**: Set up train stations where trains can start, stop, or transfer.
- **Routes**: Create and customize routes for trains to follow across the network.
- **Trains**: Add and manage trains, specifying characteristics such as speed, capacity, and schedule.
- **Schedules**: Configure train timetables to ensure efficient and realistic operations.

The simulation allows users to visually **track the movement** of trains along their routes in real-time, providing a dynamic representation of the network. Additionally, users can monitor the performance of the railway system through **statistics**, enabling them to observe how the network behaves and possibly make adjustments for optimization.

With this simulation, users can experiment with various scenarios, gain valuable insights and better understand the dynamics of a train network.
