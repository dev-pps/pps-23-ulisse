# Sprint Planning 2 (20/01 - 24/01)
[Link to backlog](./backlogs/2-backlog)

## Sprint Goal
Combine station management with route management

## Deadline
The sprint deadline is 24/01/2025.

## Sprint Review
The stakeholder is not completely satisfied because only part of the main objective was achieved. 

## Sprint Retrospective
Overall the internal management was better than in the latest sprint due to a better tracking of working time and
better group cohesion.
this week most of the time was spent studying topics related to FP (e.g. immutability and immutable state)
rather than working on product features
