## Sprint Goal
Develop landing page idea capable of navigating through all previous editors
## Deadline
The sprint deadline is 31/01/2025.

## Sprint Review
This usually starts with a review of completed Product Backlog items:
- a discussion of opportunities
- constraints and risks
- a discussion of what might be the best things to do next (potentially resulting in Product Backlog changes).

Only completed product functionality can be demonstrated

## Sprint Retrospective
“The Sprint Retrospective, which follows the Review, involves inspect and adapt regarding the process and environment. It’s an opportunity for the Team to discuss what’s working and what’s not working, and agree on changes to try.”

“A meeting facilitated by the ScrumMaster at which the complete Team discusses the just-concluded Sprint and determines what could be changed that might make the next Sprint more enjoyable or productive.”

### Changes to try
